		<p>One of my favorite things to do in my free time is play video games.  The first games that I fell in love with were The Legend of Zelda: Ocrina of Time and Pokemon: Blue version.  I have played all subsequent versions of both of those games since then.  Four years ago, my boyfriend introduced me to The World of Warcraft.  I had never played an MMO game before and loved it.  I enjoyed playing mainly DPS Caster type classes.  Shortly after that I began watching professional matches of League of Legends.  The more I watched the more I enjoyed it and wanted to learn to play the game myself.  Last summer I finally downloaded and started playing League.  My summoner name is CygnusDeneb9 after the constellation Cygnus, its brightest star Deneb, and its 9 visible stars.  The position that I currently in League is Mid Lane but I also like the AD Carry role and the Support role. My favorite professional League of Leagues team is Team SoloMid.  I love to watch their weekly games and hope to some day go see a match in person.  By watching the pros I learn how better to play the game.  I am always looking for new games to play and some day hope to work for a gaming company as a concept artist.</p>
